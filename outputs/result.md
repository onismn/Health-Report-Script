  "script": "Hi there! I want to share some important insights about your recent test results. Your Complete Blood Count (CBC) shows that everything is normal, meaning no signs of anemia or blood disorders. Your kidney function is also good, with a creatinine level of 0.90 mg/dL, so we just need to keep an eye on that over time. However, I noticed your alkaline phosphatase level is elevated at 150 U/L. This could indicate liver or bone issues, so we might need to do further testing to understand this better. Your vitamin B12 is normal, but your vitamin D is on the higher end, so let’s discuss any supplements you might need. Lastly, your HbA1c is 5.3%, which is great! Just remember to monitor your blood sugar regularly. Let’s schedule a follow-up to discuss these findings in more detail."
